# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic led to many questions and concerns in the sporting world, namely whether leagues would commit to hosting a 2020 season, and if so how to do so safely? For the league leadership that made the decision to host a 2020 season, various protocols were required to ensure the health and safety of athletes and staff. For example, the National Hockey League (NHL) implemented a bubble system, with all teams within the Western Conference playing within Edmonton, Alberta, and all teams within the Eastern Conference within Toronto, Ontario [(Gatto, 2020)](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nhl/news/nhl-bubble-hub-city-rules-teams-schedule-edmonton-toronto/72k8vc0u630k19xalra66xa3c). In a similar move, the National Basketball Association (NBA) established a bubble in Orlando, Florida within which teams could play out the remainder of the season [(Haislop, 2020)](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-bubble-rules-teams-schedule-orlando/zhap66a9hcwq1khmcex3ggabo). However, unlike the use of a bubbled league like the NHL and NBA, Major League Baseball (MLB) permitted teams to play games within their own stadiums, excluding the Toronto Blue Jays who were denied access to play within Canada by the Canadian federal government ([McNamara, 2020](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/toronto-blue-jays-home-games-buffalo-2020-season/); [Wagner, 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/sports/baseball/mlb-coronavirus-rules.html)). In choosing this approach, MLB implemented policies such as no spitting, masks being required in the dugout and bullpen, no use of saunas, twice-a-day temperature and symptom checks, and visiting team members were to remain bubbled within the hotel [(Wagner, 2020)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/sports/baseball/mlb-coronavirus-rules.html). Another such policy was to also introduce a new rule regarding extra-inning games, tied games that go beyond the regulation nine innings, in hopes of shortening the exposure experienced by players between teams [(Allen, 2020)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/30/mlb-extra-innings-rules-2020/). The rule was that if a game were to reach extra-innings, then each subsequent half-inning would begin with each team having a runner on second-base [(Allen, 2020)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/30/mlb-extra-innings-rules-2020/). The idea being that this would increase the probability of either team scoring in the half-inning, thereby shortening the amount of time athletes spent on the diamond. Yet, while this rule change was implemented as a protective measure toward the athlete, a rule change to a sport or game should also be done to ensure the fairness of the playing field. This paper looks to explore this rule change for the 2020 MLB season and whether it provides an advantage to the visitor team in extra-inning games by increasing the probability of scoring a run. As well, it is considered whether extra-inning games in general provide an advantage to the visitor team and how strategy might change in extra-inning games with and without the new rule. It additionally explores the analysis behind how this rule change would protect players by limiting on-field exposure between teams, and whether this was accomplished by shortening extra-inning games as compared to previous seasons.

# Data

## Access

This analysis uses game-log and play-by-play data for each MLB season from the 2000 MLB season to the 2020 MLB season. Game-logs and play-by-play files were obtained free of charge from and are copyrighted by [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org/) (2021). Interested parties may contact Retrosheet at [www.retrosheet.org.](https://www.retrosheet.org/). The play-by-play files were accessed using the `parse_retrosheet_pbp()` function as written by GitHub user [beanumber (Baumer, 2019)](https://github.com/beanumber/baseball_R/blob/master/scripts/parse_retrosheet_pbp.R), with the process described by Marchi et al. (2019c) in 'Appendix A' of 'Analyzing Baseball Data with R'. Other data files used include the fields dataset maintained by GitHub user maxtoki [(Max, 2013)](https://github.com/maxtoki/baseball_R/blob/master/data/fields.csv). This dataset provides the Retrosheet data event headers and can be accessed from the [baseball_R GitHub repository](https://github.com/maxtoki/baseball_R/blob/master/data/fields.csv).

## Missing Values

Regarding game-log data, four missing values were found in regulation length games and two missing values were found in extra-inning games due to tie-games. These values were removed from their respective datasets leaving N = 45,283 observations in regulation length games and N = 4,197 in extra-inning games across all seasons. Play-by-play files were also examined for missing values; however, all missing values belonged to event-type variables (e.g. the play on runner on second). These values were not removed as doing so would create issues within the data regarding analysis.

```{r missing values, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# read in the check_NA() function from script directory
source(here::here("script/check_NA.R"))

# creates dataset of missing value row and column numbers
check_NA(reg, "reg_NA")
check_NA(extras, "extras_NA")

# remove NAs in both datasets
reg <- reg %>% 
  filter(!is.na(winning_team))

extras <- extras %>% 
  filter(!is.na(winning_team))

# doublecheck NA values
check_NA(reg, "reg_NA")
check_NA(extras, "extras_NA")
```

```{r extra inning game win count, echo=FALSE}
# extra inning wins/losses totals
# winning team count
extrawin_count <- count(extras, winning_team)
extrawin_count <- extrawin_count %>% 
  # rename count column
  rename(count = n) %>% 
  # create new column for label
  mutate(game_length = "Extra")

# extra inning wins/losses by year
extra_count_yr <- count(extras, winning_team, year) %>% 
  # rename count column
  rename(count = n) %>%
  # keep only unique values
  unique()
```

```{r regular inning game win count, echo=FALSE}
# regular length wins/losses totals
regwin_count <- count(reg, winning_team)
regwin_count <- regwin_count %>% 
  # remove NA values
  filter(winning_team != "NA") %>%
  # rename count column
  rename(count = n) %>% 
  # add label column
  mutate(game_length = "Regulation")

# regular length wins/losses by year
reg_count_yr <- count(reg, winning_team, year) %>% 
  # remove NAs
  filter(winning_team != "NA") %>%
  # renamce count column
  rename(count = n) %>% 
  # keep only unique values
  unique()
```

```{r combined count, echo=FALSE}
# combine the counts for regulation and extra inning games
combined_counts <- bind_rows(regwin_count, extrawin_count)
```

## Exploratory Analysis

An exploratory analysis revealed that over all seasons the home team won more games, for both extra-inning games and regulation games (Figure 1). Analysing regulation length games by individual season also showed that across all seasons the home team won more games than the visiting team in regulation length games (Figure 2 and Table 1). Additionally, analysing each extra-inning game by individual season revealed that generally the same pattern of the home team winning more games than the visitor, with the home team winning more games in 15 of 21 seasons (Figure 3 and Table 2). However, in the 2000 and 2012 seasons both the home team and visitor won an equal number of extra-inning games with N = 101 and N = 96 games respectively (Figure 3 and Table 2). Meanwhile, the visitor won more extra-inning games in 2001 (Visitor, N = 101; Home, N = 94), 2014 (Visitor, N = 120; Home, N = 112), 2019 (Visitor, N = 109; Home, N = 99), and 2020 (Visitor, N = 36; Home, N = 32) (Figure 3 and Table 2).

# Analysis

## Bayesian Two-Sample t-test

A Bayesian two-sample t-test was performed using the `bayes.t.test()` function from the `Bolstad` package (Curran & Bolstad, 2020) to compare whether the length of extra-innings games in the 2020 MLB season was shortened by the new rule. This was done between the 2020 and 2019 season, the 2020 and 2018 season, and the 2019 and 2018 season. The first comparison was done to compare two seasons in which the rule was implemented and the visitor team won more extra inning games. The second comparison was done to compare two seasons in which the rule was implemented and the visitor won more extra-inning games in only one season. And, the last comparison was done to compare two seasons in which the rule was not implemented and the visitor won more extra-inning games in one of the seasons. Confidence interval was set to 95% for each test.

### 2020 - 2019 Comparison

The 2020 season (population, N = 68; sample, n = 60) and 2019 season (population, N = 208; sample, n = 60) comparison returned a posterior mean for the 2020 season of M = 61.95 (population mean, M = 61.73) and a posterior mean for the 2019 season of 68.62 (population mean, M = 66.85) (t(118) = -3.81, p = .0002, CI[-10.13, -3.21]). Because of the differences in population sizes (2020 season, N = 68; 2019 season, N = 208), a sample size of 60 (n = 60) was used for both datasets. The results suggest that the implementation of the runner-on-second rule did shorten the length of extra-inning games; however, given the differences in population sizes, the results may be biased due to a small sample size from the 2020 season.

### 2020 - 2018 Comparison

As an additional analysis, the 2020 season (population, N = 68; sample, n = 60) was also compared using the `bayes.t.test()` function (Curran & Bolstad, 2020) to the 2018 season (population, N = 216; sample, n = 60). Again, due to the differences in population size, a sample size of 60 was used for both datasets. This analysis returned a posterior mean of M = 61.77 for the 2020 season (population mean, M = 61.73), and a posterior mean of M = 67.72 for the 2018 season (population mean, M  = 66.23) (t(118) = -4.17, p = .000006, CI[-8.78, -3.13]). Results again suggest that the new rule shortened the length of extra-inning games; however, again the results may be biased due to the size of the 2020 dataset.

### 2019 - 2018 Comparison

As a final analysis, the 2019 season (population, N = 208; sample, n = 60) was compared to the 2018 season (population, N = 216; sample, n = 60) using the `bayes.t.test()` function (Curran & Bolstad, 2020). The sample size was kept at 60 for this analysis for the purposes of consistency. Results from this test returned a posterior mean of M = 66.03 for the 2019 season (population mean, M = 66.85), and a posterior mean of M = 65.92 for the 2018 season (population mean, M  = 66.23) (t(118) = -0.07, p = 9.42, CI[-3.05, 3.29]). Results from this test suggest that there is no difference in the length of extra-inning games between seasons without the runner-on-second rule.

## Runs-Expectancy Matrix

To understand the change in probability of a run scoring in a half-inning, a run expectancy (RE24) matrix was generated. In baseball, there are three possible states of outs before an inning is over (i.e., zero, one, or two outs). Additionally, each base (i.e., first, second, and third) can either be in a state of being occupied or not occupied. Thereby giving 24 possible base-out states (8 base states x 3 out states = 24 base-out states), thus the run expectancy matrix is sometimes referred to as the RE24 matrix (Marchi, 2019a). For this analysis, the RE24 was calculated across each season between 2000 to 2020 combined*. Table 4 shows the RE24 matrix for the combined seasons. To read this table, the the first column represents a base state with the next three columns showing an out state. Base states can be read as 0 representing an unoccupied base with 1 representing an occupied base. First base is represented by the first numeral on the left, with second base being the middle numeral, and third base being the right-most numeral. For example, reading the table at the row beginning with 010 means a runner on second. Continuing along this row, it can be seen that in this state with no outs an average number of 1.14 runs are scored, which drops to 0.69 average runs with one out, and 0.33 runs with two outs.

---
*Note: I did write code that also performs the same calculation for each individual season. 
This code has been included in this workbook as well in Appendix A below.

  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

In addition to the average runs scored, the variance and standard deviation of runs scored from a base-out state were also calculated and are displayed in Table 5. Here it can be seen that the base-out state with the greatest standard deviation is the bases loaded and no one out (111 0), with a variance of $\sigma^2$ = 3.34 and a standard deviation of $\sigma$ = 1.83. Additionally, the base-out state with the lowest standard deviation is no one on and two outs (000 2), with a variance of $\sigma^2$ = 0.19 and standard deviation of $\sigma$ = 0.44. Notably, the base-out state of runner on second and no one out is towards the middle of the base-out states in terms of standard deviation at position 11 of 24 and with a variance of $\sigma^2$ = 1.75 and standard deviation of $\sigma$ = 1.32 (Table 5).

```{r RE dist cent, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=F}
# change dataset column names to title format ->
# makes the table oh so pretty
names(dftotal_summarise) <- stringr::str_to_title(names(dftotal_summarise))

# using summarise dataset
dftotal_summarise %>% 
  # remove outs column
  dplyr::select(-Outs) %>%
  # fully capitalize SD
  dplyr::rename(SD = Sd) %>% 
  # arrange the table by SD
  dplyr::arrange(SD) %>% 
  # generate kable table
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Distribution and Central Tendency for Expected Runs for All Seasons (2000-2020) Combined") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

However, while these tables show the average expected runs from a given base-out state, there is also the question as to the probability of at least one run scoring given a base-out state. Table 6 shows the mean of value of at least one run scored given each base-out state. Looking at this table, the base-out state with the greatest probability of one or more runs scoring is the bases loaded and no outs (111 0) with a probability of 0.86, and the lowest probability of one or more runs scoring is no one on and two outs (000 2) with a probability of 0.07. Looking to the base-out state of a runner on second and no outs (010 0), or the starting state for each extra-inning game in the 2020 MLB season, it can be seen that at least one run scoring given that state has a probability of 0.62. This is compared to the standard state of beginning of an inning with no runners and no outs (000 0), which has a probability of 0.28 for at least one or more runs scoring.

```{r RE run prob, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
kableExtra::kbl(dftotal_prob1, caption = "Probability of Scoring at least One Run from a Given Base-Out State") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

## State Transitions

A half-inning of baseball lasts until a third out is made and up to that point the game moves between the various possible base-out states. For example, a regulation half-inning could progress from the first batter as follows: no runners and no outs (000 0), a runner on first with no outs (100 0), no runners and two outs (000 2), runner on second and two outs (010 2), to finally three outs and the end of the half-inning. By establishing the current base-out and the subsequent new base-out state, a transition table was produced to calculate the frequency at which one state followed another. From this transition table a proportional table was then produced to view the proportion at which one state moved to another. This table is displayed in Table 7. To read this table, each row and column represents a base-out state, with the values in each cell representing the proportion of moving from the base-out state of that row to the corresponding column base-out state. For example, the first row of the table represents the starting state of a half-inning with no runners and no outs (000 0). Looking along this row, the next most likely state is no runners and one out (000 1) at 0.67. Following that, the next most likely state is runner on first and no outs (100 0) at 0.24. Lastly, any cell with a value of 0 represents a base-out state for which it is not possible for the base-out state of that row to transition. For example, it would not be possible to transition from no runners no outs (000 0) to runner on third and one out (001 1). Looking at the above example, the probability of those series of events would be 0.00085 or 0.085% (0.24 x 0.12 x 0.047 x 0.63).

To specifically examine the transition states following runner on second and no outs (010 0), Table 8 was generated to filter for only the transition proportions following that state. Looking at this table it can be seen that the next most likely state following a runner on second and no outs is a runner on second with one out (010 1) at 0.38. This state is followed in likelihood by a runner on third with one out (001 1) at 0.27. However, this table only shows the next most likely base-out state after one at-bat. Alternatively, Table 9 shows the the likelihood of a base-out state after two at-bats, from which it can be seen that the most likely base-out state is runner on third and two outs (001 2) at 0.174. This is additionally followed in likelihood by runner on second and two outs (010 2) at 0.168. Lastly, Table 10 shows the likelihood of base-out states after three at-bats from the beginning state of runner on second and no outs (010 0). In this table it can be seen that the most likely state after three at-bats is three outs at 0.33. This is followed in likelihood by runner on first and two outs at 0.12.

## Runs Simulation

As a final analysis a multi-chain model was generated to simulate the number of runs scored in a half-inning across all seasons. For this analysis, runs scored was simulated using the formula $RUNS = (N^{(b)}_{runners} + O^{(b)} + 1) - (N^{(a)}_{runners} + o^{(a)})$, where runs scored $RUNS$ is equal to difference between the sum of runners $N_{runners}$ and outs $O$ before $(b)$ the event plus one ($1$) and the number of runners $N_{runners}$ plus outs $O$ after $(a)$ the event (Marchi et al., 2019b). The multi-chain model was generated by computing the number of runs for a given state using the given formula and then samples of size one (1) were selected for the length of a vector of length 25 using the probability weights from the transition matrix. Runs were then returned as an indexed location from the calculated runs as weighted by the probabilities provided by the transition matrix. The simulation was then set to run for 20,000 simulations, results of which can be seen in Table 11. From this table it can be seen that the most likely outcome in a half-inning is that no runs are scored. Additionally, the probability of scoring only one run can be seen as 0.14 (2837/20000), whereas the probability of scoring one or more runs can be seen as 0.27 ((2837+1276+620+286+128+48+27+11+7)/20000). Lastly, the probability of scoring two or more runs in a half-inning is 0.13 ((1276+620+286+128+48+27+11+7)/20000), slightly less than the probability of scoring only one run at 0.14.

# Discussion

Given these results, it cannot be concluded that the rule of beginning each extra-inning with a runner on second gives an advantage to the visitor team over the home team anymore than standard extra-inning play. While the rule does increase the expected average number of runs, both teams experience this increase. The disadvantage comes from if the visitor team were to score in extra-inning games, they would only require one run to win the game. Whereas, if the visitor were to score in the top-half of the inning, the home team would require two runs to win the game. Effectively, it is the structure of extra-inning games to begin that gives the visitor an advantage as long as they score in the top-half of the inning. This structure is just exaggerated by the rule of beginning each half-inning with a runner on second by increasing the probability that at least one run will score. However, given that the most likely outcome after three at-bats with a runner on second and no outs is three outs and the end of the half-inning, this advantage may not be so vast. Which may also be explained by other seasons in which the visitor won more extra-inning games than the home team. Additionally, it may also be the case that the structure of extra-inning games lends itself to more randomness and that a similar effect would appear if more games were played under the same structure. Or, that the randomness would become lessened and as more extra-inning games were played a similar effect of regulation length games with the home team winning more than the visitor would appear.
